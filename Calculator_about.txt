This application software named Calculator [Version 
0.1] wasn't developed in one night. It took relentless 
effort, endurance, and firm belief of the single 
application software developer named Mr. Rishikesh 
Jha - a Physics graduate of the University of Mumbai 
via St. Xavier's College.
Having a Physics background, he never had any degree 
in the field of application software development but he 
was able to develop this application software because 
he had that one thing which is not seen even in degree 
holders today-self belief. He learnt Python prgramming, 
data analysis and animations using Python libraries like 
matplotlib, scipy, numpy, pandas side by side when he 
was a Physics undergraduate.
After completing graduation, he found his passion 
in the application software development. He learnt 
Tkinter in one month and then finally developed 
this software within a span of 5 days.
